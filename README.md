# Course Registration System (Java Swing + JPA + PostgreSQL)

## Overview
A simple **Course Registration System** where students can be added, updated, deleted, and enrolled in courses with seat limits.  

Built with:
- **Java Swing** for the UI  
- **JPA (Hibernate)** for ORM  
- **PostgreSQL** as the database  

> Note: Since this is a desktop (Swing) app, only the **database** is containerized. Run the UI locally and connect to PostgreSQL running in Docker.

## Requirements
- Java 17+  
- Maven  
- PostgreSQL installed locally **or** Docker + Docker Compose
